## homebrew-tap

Homebrew Tap of Seqera products and tools.


### Formulae

This is the case of `wave-cli`.

Install formulae with one of the following:
```bash
$ brew install seqeralabs/tap/<formula>
```

Or:
```bash
$ brew tap seqeralabs/tap  # once off configuration
$ brew install <formula>
```


### Casks

No Seqera casks yet.

Install casks with one of the following:
```bash
$ brew install --cask seqeralabs/tap/<cask>
```

Or:
```bash
$ brew tap seqeralabs/tap  # once off configuration
$ brew install --cask <cask>
```

<!-- Would comment this out, does not generally sound like a good practice. -->
<!-- If you get a dialog stating the cask is broken try installing with `--no-quarantine`. -->


### Documentation
